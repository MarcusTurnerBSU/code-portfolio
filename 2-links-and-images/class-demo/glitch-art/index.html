        <h2>What is Glitch Art?</h2>
        <p>
            <dfn>Glitch Art</dfn> is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film <cite>A Colour Box</cite> (1935) by Len Lye, the video sculpture <cite>TV Magnet</cite> (1965) by Nam June Paik and more contemporary work such as <cite>Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn</cite> (2007) by Cory Arcangel.
